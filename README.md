# PowerVR Flash SDK
PowerVR integration with Flash/Stage3D. PowerVR helps to setup 3D assets creation pipeline for your artists. [PowerVR Tools](http://imgtec.com/tools/powervr-tools/) includes exporters (Autodesk 3DS Max, Autodesk Maya & Blender) and standalone conversion tools (GUI and command-line variants â€“ currently import COLLADA files).

To ensure the data stored in the container is as efficient and PowerVR-friendly as possible, the exporter/converter tools also include options to remove unnecessary properties (e.g. redundant texture coordinates), choose how the data will be uploaded to the graphics driver.

## Features
- Skinned meshes
- Bone batching based on matrix palette size
- Data format choice (store data as float, byte, uint etc.)
- Interleaving of vertex data if desired
- Mesh instancing
- Multiple texture co-ordinate sets
- Parented nodes
- Polygon stripping
- Polygon/vertex sorting
- Tangent space generation
- Custom user data (Plugins Only)

## Todo
- PowerVR Effects support
- Integration with Away3D
- ATF Pipeline
